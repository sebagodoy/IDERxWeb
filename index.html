        <h1>Atomic simulation tools</h1>

            <div class="text">
                This page shows and explain the use of a series of several resources developed with the intention facilitate, organize and automatize
                various commont tasks when working with some well known codes for atomistic simulation, specially the comercial code VASP
                (link <u><a href="https://www.vasp.at/">here</a></u>).
                The resources, tools and tips here are being created and actualized as part a my work in heterogeneous catalysis as a Phd student in
                the <i>laboratory of Carbon and Catalysis <b>CarboCat</b></i> of the University of Concepcion (Chile). Check out our research group's
                webpage <u><a href="https://sites.google.com/view/carbocatudec"> here!</a></u>.

            <div class="text">
                Now about the resources here:

                        and to analyze some output files. Mostly written in python and bash.

        <h2>Tools for VASP files</h2>
            <div class="text">
                All the tools here are included in the VASPtools folder at the main repository
                <u><a href="https://github.com/sebagodoy/IDERx">https://github.com/sebagodoy/IDERx</a></u> (along with the IDERx enviroment) to download or directly clone.
                All of these are free software(<u><a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/"> GNU General Public License </a></u>) and any comment or suggestion
                would be appreciated.
                <br>
                Most of these are written in python 3.6.9 or bash from a begginers level of complexity, they work properly enough for being used
                on our daily research work (on a ubuntu 16.04 enviroment) but there is plenty of room for optimization. Since these tools are a side
                product of an ongoing work in our lab, new tools and constant actualizations are being made.
                <br>
                The nomenclature of most this tools is of the form <code>VASP.<i>file</i>.<a>action</a></code> refering to the kind of VASP
                <i>file</i> they relate and some description of the intended <i>action</i>. Also, some of the codes may still have promps and comments
                in spanish (it being my native languaje). Traduction to english promps is one of the intended tasks in queue.

                the type of job (IBRION tag) in the OUTCAR and its proper termination. Reports final energy (sigma->0) and dispersion D3 corrections
                    (if available) for relaxations and single point calculations or lists the frequencies and intensities for frequency-type runs.</li>

            <ul style="padding-left:30px; margin-top:5px">

                    selective dynamics patterns can be quickly applied to consecutive groups of atoms like layers in the model .

            <ul style="padding-left:30px; margin-top:5px">
                <li><code>VASP.IR.Intensities.py</code>: Reads dipole corrections (if available) from OUTCAR in each displacement of a frequency

                <li><code>VASP.IR.cat.py</code>: Compiles the IR spectra from various logfiles produced by VASP.IR.Intensities.py to compile on a single

        <!-- neb -->
        <div class="text"><h3 id="neb">&#x25B6 neb and dimmer construction and analysis: </h3> nudget elastic band (neb) types of runs require a serie of geometry files
            in the reaction coordinate from stable initial and final geometries. A couple tools to construct these interpolated geometries are:
            <ul style="padding-left:30px; margin-top:5px">
                <li><code>VASP.neb.Lineal.py</code>: produces linearly interpolated geometries for a neb run from an initial POSCAR_1 and final POSCAR_2 files.</li>

                <li><code>VASP.neb.Curved.py</code>: From an initial, final and an estimated TS geometries, this code will parabolically interpolate and try tro generate
                n equidistant geometries for a neb calculation. Selective dynamics are taken from the estimated TS file</li>

                <li><code>VASP.neb2XDATCAR.py</code>: Invoqued from  neb folder it generates a XDATCAR type of file called neb2movie_XDATCAR5 containing the sequence of
                    images in the neb 00/ 01/,  ... folders. The vile can be opened with VMD (<u><a href="./WebFiles/TnR.html#Software">check this</a></u>) as a movie of the reaction path, which is very useful
                    to quickly check that the neb path represents the intended reaction step after (default option) or before (enter "CONTCAR" when asked the filename) the run.

                <li><code>VASP.neb2POSCAR.py</code>: Invoqued from  neb folder it will produce a POSCAR-like file that includes the positions of the relaxed atoms in each
                    one of the images in 00/,  01/,  ... folders. It may help visualize some neb paths but it may (more often than not) render a crowded image not
                    very usefull, generating a neb movie with <code>VASP.neb2XDATCAR.py</code> to visualize with VMD could be a better option. By default it uses the
                    initial POSCAR images but "CONTCAR" can be requested when asken about filenames to use the end-of-the-run geometries.
            </ul>


            Dimer calculations using the VTST tools (<u><a href="https://theory.cm.utexas.edu/vtsttools/">Link here!</a></u>) start using a POSCAR and MODECAR files
            for atomic positions in the estimated transition state (TS) geometry and its and reaction coordinate direction, respectivelly. The restricted relaxation
            produces the equivalent CENTCAR geometry and NEWMODECAR direction files.

            <ul style="padding-left:30px; margin-top:5px">
                <li><code>VASP.CENTCAR.Desplaza.py</code>: Usefull to check if a
                    dimer calculation is pointing in the intended reaction coordinate. Called from the neb folder, this code will generate a XDATCAR-like containing
                    a sequence of geometries displaced from a central configuration (CENTCAR by default, but accepts POSCAR or CONTCAR-like files) in the direction
                    defined by a MODECAR-like file (NEWMODECAR by default, but MODECAR can be entered when asked). If you choose not to erase the individual images,
                    CONTCAR files of the displaced images will be kept in the neb folder, their sequence can be quickly reviewed using <code>VESTA CONTCAR_*</code>.
                    <br>
                    Note this code's promp is in spanish, translating it is one of the (many)
                    pending tasks.</li>

            </ul>

            The process of converge and confirm a transition state geometry can be dificult and tedious, some advice is given in the Tips & External resources
            of this page.
